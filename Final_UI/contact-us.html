          <p>RoadRadar was created to address the "aging road" issue, that contributes to accidents involving motorcyclists. These issues refer to a wide variety of concerns such as structural road failures, like potholes, or simply old road surface. RoadRadar will let its users report any issue or information about the specific condition through a user-friendly and anonymous website. These feedbacks will be added to our datasets to convey the overall picture of our road network.</p>
